My mother is a lunch lady at my local middle school (about to be jobless in the fall), and my dad is a low level data manager who has since left our home. I'm not the poorest of poor, but I'm absolutely in the lower echelon or two of income at this school and entirely dependant on a large financial aid package.
I see money as something to be guarded, so I don't spend it frivolously. My clothes come from goodwill, my furniture and books from either places like craigslist or ebay or the side of the road, and I feed myself about 2x a week while on-campus using the free food chat (though, that'll probably be very inactive come fall). I allow myself a budget to spend on things valuable to me - namely, on christmas presents for friends and family. I stop caring about the price as their happiness is far more valuable to me than the money is. A lot of this frugality stems from the fact that I alone am paying for my education; my mother and father can't afford to contribute to the EFC, so that burden rests on me and my income. As a result, I work a ton over the summers and plenty while at school, but I do my best to get it done. Thus, I pinch pennies to the best of my ability to make sure I can make my friends happy and continue to pursue my education.
