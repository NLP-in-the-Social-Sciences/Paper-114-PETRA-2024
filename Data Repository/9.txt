I get it. I’m a 51F, and I worked full time during the day and went to school at night. My food budget in 1991 was about $3 a day. I ate a banana, a yogurt and a bagel. I cannot stand yogurt TO THIS DAY. What I didn’t do then but probably should have done is go to a food bank. It never even occurred to me because I had work. But they will treat you with respect and give you enough to eat. That’s what they are there for. Once you have more in your stomach, you will feel more positive and will be in a better position to see what resources the college might have available for you. When you are a veterinarian, you can send some food bank donations their way as a way of thanks. I really don’t know how I got through it, apart from just keeping on. I graduated, went on to get a Master’s and 30 years later, everything is just fine. I have never forgotten how hard it was and I well remember being scared and exhausted as I’m sure you are right now. I now have a working farm and grow produce for my local food bank. Go to the food bank as often as you need to. Those puppies and kitties need you!
