I understand, and I also grew up in a family that just immigrated to the US and was very poor initially, my family wasn't on their two feet until I reached the age of 14, and I could not afford the things that my friends could, I don't understand why people on this sub complain that low income students get it free when they have tuition, (Am white), They're basically crying that someone else has an advantage that could propel them to a higher status, well guess what, You already grew up in that status and had all those privileges, you can pay for your tuition, we can't.
