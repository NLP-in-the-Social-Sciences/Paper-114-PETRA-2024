I grew up very poor. None of my parents or grandparents finished high school. I finished high school, but couldn't afford college, so I worked multiple jobs for years. In my late 20s, I wanted to switch careers. I knew I was smart and could do the job, but I couldn't even get an interview. So I took night classes at the community college. It took me 5 years to get a 2 year degree, but that got me interviews! Right before I graduated with my associates, I got a job working in the accounting department for a local company. I've been here 6 years now, and have gotten multiple raises and promotions. I just needed that degree to get me in the door.
