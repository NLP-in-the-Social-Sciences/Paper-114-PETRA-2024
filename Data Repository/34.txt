I was able to get really good funding and keep my debts to 80K (my first year of grad school only cost me 10K, although the second cost me 20 because the funding changed- the rest is from undergrad. I am also eligible for repayment assistance which has reduced my monthly payments a lot (from 900 to 200) - the repayment assistance in Canada is based on national average incomes, but since I live in a very low cost area, where wages are relatively low compared to the national average - it works out well for me. Since I have a disability, they are also paying down my principal and my debt should be gone in ten years from the time I graduate. Its not 100% golden, even with my higher income. Housing expenses have gone nuts in canada. I live in an old trailer and that is keeping me and my family comfortable while we pay down debts and save money for a better place. But am I better off than before I went to school? Definitely. Will this specific plan work for you? probably not. You need to figure out where your strengths are and what makes the most sense for you in your situation.
