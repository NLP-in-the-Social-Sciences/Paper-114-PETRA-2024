My mother works a low-wage job in food service, and my father's an alcoholic ex-coke addict who's been unemployed or in prison most of my life. Basically a single parent family. So, my family is very poor, but I was a good student. This meant I got the full payout from Pell and TAP grants, on top of the merit scholarship I got to UB. A massive part of the reason I went to UB was the fact that it was cheap, and would be fully paid for through these monies. I couldn't go to the fancy school in another state since the amount they offered me was laughable. In the end, I was extremely fortunate to not have any debt, and I even made money from the excess disbursements. I used that money to pay for school supplies and monthly bus passes to or from school (I'm a commuter -- 1.5 hours each way). I'm currently in grad school looking to get my PhD.
