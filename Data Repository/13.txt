I was working 50 hours a week night shift in a factory fixing automated machinery and going to school for electrical engineering during the day. I was only part time at school. I did it for 3 years and dropped out of school it wasnâ€™t worth it to me I was already making decent money and would have to take a pay cut once I finished school to start as an entry level engineer.
I would tell you to cut back on classes and work more. Most employers help with tuition too. Mine was paid for 100% by my employer.
Joining the military is also a way many people of less means are able to get expensive degrees. They will help you get to your goal of getting an advanced degrees.
