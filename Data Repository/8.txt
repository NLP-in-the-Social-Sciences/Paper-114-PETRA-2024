My university even offered emergency grants and loans (with no interest) for students experiencing hardships. Also check out if they have a food pantry for students, my community college had one that was well stocked with food as well as toiletries.
I was in a similar situation when I was young, working full time to support myself, barely getting by, doing poorly in my classes. It’s not an option for everyone, but I eventually dropped out, worked for a few years and saved money, and then went back to school when I was 24. Students over 24 qualify for more financial aid typically since their officially independent from their parents so parental income isn’t included with FAFSA (assuming you’re in the US). I got a pell grant and full paid tuition so I even have a few thousand every semester to go towards my living expenses. If you don’t have to go to school right now, don’t. I’m assuming you’re still young, you have plenty of time to get a degree without sacrificing your wellbeing.
