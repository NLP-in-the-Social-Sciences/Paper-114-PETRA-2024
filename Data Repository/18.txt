I was in a similar situation in college OP. Worked multiple jobs at the same time during college and couldnâ€™t afford to go to school full time even after all that, so I had to defer my graduation date by a few years. 0 contributions from parents because growing up we had no money. At the time I had no savings and living paycheck to paycheck.
Fast forward to now, I have a job in my field and finally in a position to put money away.
As dreary as it seems now, keep your head up OP. Things will get better.
