Back in the time I was going to school, I was always among the poorest kids in the class, nearly no one wants to make friends with me cos I didn’t have any money (actually my family didn’t) and I didn’t have nice clothes to wear so they would feel embarrassed when hanging out with a friend like me. Even my relatives, they looked my family down and underestimated me and my sister a lot since we were not as wealthy as them. So I decided to try my best to bring up my family, so my parents could be proud of me and my sister can have someone to follow the footsteps. Then I got good results in college and have quite a good job in a big city (300km away from my hometown) and support my family finance (not much but still good), after that, whenever I come home, my relatives never have the same attitude to me n family as the old time anymore. Growing in a poor family gave me big simulation to try my best. Now my sister can have many good things that I couldn’t have back then, good for her.
