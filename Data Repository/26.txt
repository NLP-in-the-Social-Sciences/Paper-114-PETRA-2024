I came from a family of 8 making $40k a year, no college degrees. I graduated in 2022 at the age of 23, and within that year I was making more than my father ever had. Because I was from such a poor family, my EFC was 0%, and because I purposely chose to go to a private out of state institution with a lot of money to give, I got a full ride (just a fun side note: I applied to state colleges who would’ve charged me 15k a year to attend). 2 years in community college for cheap or free (cheap when I was part time, free when full time) and then transferred out of state and got $75k tuition for absolutely free. No debt and I’m making more than anyone in my immediate family has any prospect of making. I could not do my job without my degree.
I will also say college immediately lifted me out of poverty too, by giving me access to on campus jobs, workstudy, and fafsa refunds every semester. The networking opportunities also continued to benefit me post graduation. I gained more wealth in college than I ever expected a person could. Obviously this is not necessarily standard but if people play their cards right it’s possible, and I’m always championing to the genuinely poor kids I know that they better not listen to their wealthier friends when they say college is a scam. It is different for adults who go to college later in life, because they are not dependents and may not have any dependents or spouse of their own. Often on paper adults seem like they’d be more capable of covering the costs of college than they really are, so that’s a tough one. Still talking to a college advisor and seeing what options you have (and not only looking at in state options!!!!) can’t hurt.
