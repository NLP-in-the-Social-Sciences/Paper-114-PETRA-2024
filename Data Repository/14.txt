I was broke throughout college and Graduate school. I worked part-time during college (minimum wage at the time was $9.00/hr) and I rented a small room in town that was about $300/month. I went to the food-bank a few times a month with a suitcase (rode the bus). My college even had a pathetic little food-bank for students because most of us were struggling. Sometimes it had nothing but dirty carrots and other times they might sneak in some old bagels and doughnuts. I was able to get food stamps a few times for a certain amount of time before they would require me to re-apply (which was difficult-since I would have to spend the whole day at the social security office and it cut into school and work time).
In graduate school I was able to get a decent gig that was technically a full-time night job as a caregiver for an older lady. I was able to sleep part way through the night and get paid for the whole night. She was quiet and didn't mind if I did some of my homework in the evening while she watched TV. I was still exhausted and somewhat broke but it was by far the best pay and best schedule I could find to get me through my Master's degree.
