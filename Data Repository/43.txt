I grew up dirt poor and lived in a family of 5 with a household income of about $20k until last December when I moved in with my Dad in a household of 2 with a very comfortable income. Being poor fucking blows. All my friends got to vacation when the only times I would leave the state were to see family maybe once every few years. We were on state insurance and food stamps and every government assistance program you could find. They were helpful but limiting. My friends used to get angry with me because I couldn't afford to do things with them ever. And seconded on literally all of your points but especially the one about having people over- my friends lived in nice homes when I lived in a trailer. I was always so scared people were going to talk shit about me. And the stress. Being poor fucking sucks. I always had to worry if we'd have money for food or if we'd be late on our water bill (again).
