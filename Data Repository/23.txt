My mom's a nurse which where I'm from is a decent paying job, but she has bad asthma and other health issues that put her out of work for years when I was a kid. We were homeless for a few months at one point, lived in subsidized housing and got by on welfare, social security disability, and charity from our church. I started working a paper route to help pay the bills when I was ten, got two real jobs when I turned fifteen and could get working papers.
Went to a state school for undergrad and masters, worked 40+ hours at multiple jobs and took some loans to get through it. I actually think Cornell pays PhD students pretty well, although many of my peers from more privileged backgrounds might disagree. I've been able to save money for emergencies, help my mom out when she needs it, and pay back a decent chunk of undergrad loans on TA and fellowship stipends, plus a couple hours here and there working for a few offices on campus, and a few "fellowships" and other awards that came with money ($500-$2000 generally).
I don't spend a lot though. I live pretty far from campus where its cheaper, mostly buy clothes from the Salvo or Costco, got furniture from garage sales or when undergrads move out of their apartments, don't turn up the heat too high in the winter, find ways for Cornell, grants, or societies to pay for travel (even conference travel is a treat when you've never really been anyplace outside the city you grew up in). Probably my biggest splurge is eating out with friends, although I'm real basic with what I eat when I'm on my own, lots of oatmeal, rice, beans, potatoes, and eggs. In normal times there's a ton of free food on campus too. I can't really complain, you gotta play the hand you're dealt and I know a ton of people that have it worse than I do.
