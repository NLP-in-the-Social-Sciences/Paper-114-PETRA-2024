I grew up poor, and I did life backwards , had kids then worked on my degree. It took me 10 yrs on and off to complete my degree because I was moving around so much, could only take one class a semester, loosing credits etc, but I did it got a bachelors in business (first in my family to graduate), 2 certificates later and in less than 10 yrs make 6 figures. Sure, I got student loans but what I pay a month on them is less than 5% of my take home pay. Totally worth it.
