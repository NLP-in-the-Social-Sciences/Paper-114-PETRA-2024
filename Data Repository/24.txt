My single mother is unemployed, barely makes enough to feed a family of four. I made it through high school thanks to some grants and still had debts to pay later. I work 20 hours at X to pay everything you can think of. I have to support my family, mostly in paying school fees and some other necessities that my siblings need- I am the first born, first to attend college, so they all look up to me. Money to me is the only thing that matters, I consider it my main limitation. I'm always very nervous when dealing with money and looking at my bank account balances is a source of stress so I avoid it as much as I can. As a CS major I always feel like I am left behind because I couldn't access most of electronics and other resources my classmates grew up with and still can't. In any case, I have actually never felt poor, more so because in most cases X got me covered, well beside student loans waiting for me after graduation.
