Struggled with keeping up academicly due to sexualized violence I experienced while a student. Ended up pushing through in 5 yrs and taking out more loans. Hindsight, even just a semester off would have forced me to prioritize my health. Ended up worse financially because I kept ignoring signs of burnout, and bad patterns negitively impacted my futute jobs.
I do believe pursuing an Bachelors of Science helped me find confidence in my intellect as a woman, but I had to have a lot of distance (and good therapy) to detatch it from the financial frustrations. I held a lot of resentment.
