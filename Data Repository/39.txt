When I was talking to this one girl in my linguistics class, she had absolutely no idea where or what East LA was. She was also surprised when I told her that I had never been on an airplane while she mentioned that her family likes to travel to a different country every summer. I was awfully shy, but one of my linguistics professors tried to push me to get an internship. He mentioned that he's managed to get his students in at Google. I would have taken him up on the offer to try, but I took summer classes during my two summers at X and didn't really have time for an internship. I wish I would have done one though as I was totally unprepared for my first real job interview that I had lined up by a X alumna. Overall though, what people have been saying is true. You'll notice the wealth. I will never forget sitting behind an international student who was shopping for $300 pairs of sweats instead of paying attention to the lecture going on. Also, people can't often tell if you're low income. My first semester, I kept seeing the same solicitor during lunch who said something along the lines of "It would be great if you could donate $200..". Even the solicitors liked to assume that X student automatically equals rich, but that's not always the case. If only she knew that I was on food stamps/CalFresh.
