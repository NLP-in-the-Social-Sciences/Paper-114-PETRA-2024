I felt this too much definitely. I felt so alone at university, especially since I moved away from home to go to school. in addition I was the only person who picked a school none of my high school friends ended up going. I was in debt, felt like i couldn't connect to other students etc. The school was predominately affluent, and white students, which I was not. Just the socioeconomic and cultural differences made it hard for me to connect to others and make friends. I had no close support network. The imposter syndrome lead me to change my lifestyle for the worse to try to fit in and made me question my identity. For the first two years of uni, I hadn't learned the mental tools to deal with being a social outcast, as I was never one in my hometown. I had depression the whole time and felt like i was in a nightmare. The last two years I wasn't as depressed because I understood better how the "culture" at my campus worked.

The only thing that kept me positive was the gym, which I can't live without now. The upside of this situation was that I experienced how it sucks to be isolated. I would never wish it upon anybody.
