My mom works at a grocery store, my dad has an office job. I work 3+ jobs during the school year, 20-30hrs per week. I pay bills most students don't even think about (phone bill, insurance, rent, monthly loan payments, etc.). I try to keep my monthly grocery bill under $35. Feels like I'm always behind (esp knowing I will be graduating w hella debt) and I also don't feel comfortable saying I am poor bc I know many many students are much worse off than me.
