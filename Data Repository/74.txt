I’ve never posted in here before and I don’t know if my questions may seem minuscule compared to the ones i see here. 
I’m a 20 year old 2nd year in college with no savings. I come from a low income family and go to a really expensive school but got relatively good financial aid and take out about 6k in loans per year. I have a job on campus where I make about $100 a week but I don’t really know how to go about saving or developing good habits. I have a BOA checking account and secured credit card. I’m majoring in psychology and possible biology; (I want to get my PhD in psychology and maybeeee go to med school for psychiatry.) When I get my refund check from school in about 2 weeks it’ll be about $3k, because my school charges are less this semester, should I save this or use this to pay back loans? Also, what are some good options to start saving and developing good habits? my sister recommended putting my money into a CD so I can have that money for the summer and future but I am not sure about my options. 
Also, I have never filed taxes and I think I made more than 5k this year, where do I go &amp; how do I go about getting my pay stubs and info to file taxes? I had about 3 jobs in 2017 and made a lot in the summer that I spent really fast. I apologize if this was a lot feel free to give whatever advice you want!
