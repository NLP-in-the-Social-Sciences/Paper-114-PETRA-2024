My college had a student run food bank on campus (actually was pretty awesome, I volunteered there a bunch when I could.) We also got free bus/train passes, free gym membership, free food and tshirts at events at least once a week, career center workshops like resume building, free tutoring services, free editing for essays, even a student run “fix it Friday” where people would help fix broken phones and stuff. Healthcare center gave free condoms. Our library would give free scantrons and blue books (required for exams and can be like 10 bucks each) if you asked nicely. There were alumni mentoring events to help you find someone from your desired career path to talk to. I never bought textbooks, always used online pdfs or shared textbooks with other students.
Honestly sometimes when you are struggling in college, you realize how awesome people can be and how many other people are also struggling. I was amazed at how nice some people were and how many people bent rules for others to save 5-10 dollars here and there, which really adds up!!!! I paid it forward whenever I could.
As a side note, I always sold or traded my class notes for a few extra dollars. It made a good side hustle. I’d take good class notes (electronically) and sell them to classmates who wanted them. I “sold” them for free food, traded for other notes, got a phone case from one girl, and maybe $100 over the course of a few years. NOT homework or anything graded, just lecture notes, textbook summaries, etc.
