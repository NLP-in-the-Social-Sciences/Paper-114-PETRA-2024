The "ramen everyday" concept seems to be based more on "I don't have a job or money because my parents used to do everything for me. Now they pay for school but they don't cook for me and I don't have income, so ramen it is!"
That's not the case for people like you who actually have to work to afford all of it. I worked between 40-60 hours per week at 3 jobs to fund school and survival. I don't wish it on anyone and feel for anyone in that position because it feels like an endless nightmare. My social life didn't exist and my health was a nightmare.
But just remember that you're doing this for a reason. I make more than enough now and have time to breathe again, and I'll always credit it to not giving up even though the cards were stacked against me more than they were for most of my peers. Keep doing what you need to do and you'll find yourself in a better place.
