When I finished my first bachelors in 2001 it did put me in a good position to make a higher wage and move up faster into a management position. But then 2008 happened, I lost my job, and kind of started at the beginning. I was able to go back to school and get advanced degrees. Once again those have provided me with a lot of professional opportunities folks without those degrees don’t have access to. It’s also starting me in jobs with much higher pay scales or in more senior positions because my education counts as professional experience. At the same time I spent many years living like a student again and barely scraped by at times. I also wasn’t making enough to not take out student loans. My first degrees cost $1600-1800 a semester (in the 90s) so I was able to get through school with no debt by getting scholarships, working part time, and getting some support from my family. Young people today don’t generally have those options due to the cost of tuition and salaries vs cost of living. My other degrees were also expensive and I now have student loan debt. But I also have pathways to pay it down faster through jobs with incentives.
