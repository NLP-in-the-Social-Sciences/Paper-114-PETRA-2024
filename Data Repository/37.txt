I was the first kid in my family to finish HS, I'm the 3rd of 4, & the only one to go to college. I took out loans & worked my way through college. Immediately after college I was making more than both of my parents combined. Now, over 20 years later, I'm comfortably middle class & I'm happy that my kids have a better start on life.
