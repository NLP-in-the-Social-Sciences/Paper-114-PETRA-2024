A lot of people around me at this school come from families that live comfortably. I, however, am poor. Like my mom makes less than 30k a year. I feel like people are hearing me but they’re not listening. We’re also at a disadvantage because the schooling in my area isn’t as rigorous as LA or Bay Area kids. Nonetheless, I’m here. My tuition or room and board is expensive. Not even 33k worth of grants and scholarships and loans could pay for all of my school. And I also didn’t come to college with a laptop. I don’t have enough money for books. How the hell am I supposed to be an engineer without a laptop. That’s like the 1 thing I need. This sucks hard. It’s a fun adventure, but the real world is fucking brutal.
