I went from making $7.50 an hour to graduating and making $54 an hour. Insane when my little cousin told me years before why she didn’t work. She said there’s no point in working when you’re a teenager if you can’t help it. I needed to because my family was poor. But I finally understood what she was saying. She said she’d make what she’ll make in a whole year working as a teenager making $7 an hour within a couple of months once she gets the good grades and secures a great job. Needless to say I make 14x more then when I worked in college.
