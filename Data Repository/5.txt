My parents could no longer afford to keep me fed with a roof over my head while I attended college, so I've had a job since I was 20. I've had to take a year off just to get enough savings to drop down to part time in order to have time for school. I cannot afford to go to graduate school and get a masters, simply because I don't have the money to pay for it much less the money to live if I were to even attend. I've had to change majors because it would have taken an extra year which I couldn't afford. My mental health has definitely degraded from constant all nighters, forcing myself to take large amounts of caffeine to stay awake to take an exam and then go do an eight hour shift, just to do it all again two weeks for the next exam. I did this for 3 years while in school. The type of life is for those with a strong mental and resolve or else you'll just kill yourself.
I recently graduated and cooling off before I find employment with my degree.
