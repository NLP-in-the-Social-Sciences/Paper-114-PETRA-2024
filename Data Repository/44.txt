As another low-income asian, many of the things you have said here hit me pretty hard. Like I remember getting bullied for wearing the same set of clothes every week and for living in a"disgusting" house, which made me so ashamed that I never invited friends over in all 4 years of high school. I remember feeling embarrassed at lunch bc all my friends could bring lunch from home but the only thing i could afford was the school lunch, and while my friends go on vacation every year, my family has never bought an airplane ticket in my entire life. And while all my classmates were talking about all of their college visits, I couldn't relate to them at all bc we can't afford to travel. I worked my ass off to get into a T20 bc I felt that a T20 acceptance was my "way out". So yeah i get it. I'm on the other end of the fence now though (just graduated high school) and everything will turn out fine in the end.
