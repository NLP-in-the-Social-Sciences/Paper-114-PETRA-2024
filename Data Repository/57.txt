I'm in my junior year, and the pressure is definitely starting to get to me... The statistics published by the university I go to show that over 60% of students have parents with advanced degrees, making in excess of $150k per year, while my mom just has her certification to be a paralegal and my dad has been a mechanic since graduating high school. Neither really have the money to put me through, and my dad's since disowned me, so I rely almost entirely on loans and scholarships, say for money I save through internships.

I'm persuing a bachelor's in mechanical engineering, and given how hard the course material has gotten, I worry that I'll crack and it'll all be for nothing. Being LGBTQ+ also doesn't help, since I go to school in the south and have dealt with a lot of crap for being out, mostly from non-students. Beyond discrimination, it's just frustrating because the majority of the other students I interact with never talk about struggling financially, a fact I'd guess comes from their parents having at least their bachelor's degrees and the above financial statistic.
