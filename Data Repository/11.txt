I was in a lucky financial situation where my tuition was completely covered by grants as i was an independent student, and i tried to not take loans and worked instead to pay my rent and feed myself. it was unsustainable even though my major could be considered easier than yours, and i was constantly breaking down over how hungry i was because i kept running out of money for food and wasn't anywhere near a food bank within public transportation distance. i decided to just take the federal loans the following semester.
i know you said you're trying not to take out loans for your undergrad because you're looking to attend vet school, but honestly, your mental health will thank you in the long run. as long as you don't take out any private loans, you'd be in much better shape.
