Used Pell grants and state need grants to cover community college. Then got a work study job at my community college to build experience and cover remaining tuition expenses. After graduating from community with an associates, was able to get an entry level IT job. Paid for my bachelors tuition in cash from my job, taking night and weekend classes to fit around work. With the bachelors and the experience was able to get better and better jobs over time. 17 years from starting and am a manager in the cyber security industry, making over 200k. It’s not that remarkable of a story but I feel pretty good about pulling myself up to a better place than where I started and most of all think it’s worth sharing because anyone could do it too.
