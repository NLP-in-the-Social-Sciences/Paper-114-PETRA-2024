As the first person in my family to go to college (and not just try to marry rich), I can say that it absolutely helped me come out of poverty. From living in a trailer growing up, to owning my second home nowâ€¦ it was worth it. That being said. I went back to school for a 2 year degree (after my bachelors) to work in healthcare and I earn almost double with that as I did with my bachelors. So you should definitely do your research. It depends on what you study!
