I grew up very poor. I lived and still do live in a very LCOL area. My mom made around $25k. When I was in high school I got my CNA and started working at 17 years old and made $9ish an hour. I went to college and got my degree in nursing (RN). I started out making $21.50 an hour at a hospital in Alabama and now Iâ€™m a director of a home health agency making $82k (again very LCOL area). So yes college definitely was worth it, but I think it depends on your degree.
